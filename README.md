Objective:  Students will develop a computer program of their choice. Students are given at least 12 hours of in-class time to complete a “program with a purpose”
I created a CS50 Text Based Program Jeopardy Game using C language that randomly chooses 4 categories for the Jeopardy Board and allows the user 180 seconds to play the game and “earn or lose” money.
